	LSExample
		An example project that uses the LlamaSettings
		stuff.  Just a basic example of using it.  It is
		also my test application.  There is an example
		settings plist in there that shows examples of all
		settings widgets.

	LlamaSettings
		The actual code library.  Just drag this folder
		into your project, and it should build fine.
		LlamaSettings works with iPhone SDK 2.x and 3.x
